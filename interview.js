output 2 movies that match the length of flight
input array of movies flight duration


function flightMov(duration, movies) {


  movie1 + movie2 === duration;
}


/* Imagine you are working on an application that provides movie streaming facility to customers in flights.

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

Write a function that takes an integer flight_time (in minutes) and a list of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two movies equal to the flight_time.

When building your function:

Assume your users will watch exactly two movies Don't make your users watch the same movie twice Optimize for runtime over memory You are allowed to use any built in functions or class necessary as long as you are optimizing for runtime
